# CornellCraft Tours
[CornellCraft](cornellcraft.com) is hosting virtual orientation events, with one of our offerings being virtual campus
tours. This plugin gives players their own tour guide (in the form of an NPC) which they can summon or dismiss. 

When summoned, it will ask them where they want to go next, displaying the nearest destinations. Once the player 
chooses, the NPC will walk them to that location (returning to the player if it gets too far), until they arrive, where
it then stops and tells them about where they are. The player is then asked where to go next, or they can dismiss the
guide and explore on their own. The guide will disappear with a cool particle effect.
